(1, 'Arsenal Team 2008/09 Profile', 'Helen Johnson', 'The Arsenal team that would go on to play for Man City…', 'GK: Manuel Almunia – The error-prone Spanish goalkeeper who almost played for England at the height of their goalkeeping troubles, because that was the answer to their problems – another error-prone keeper. Almunia was in his second season here, and never looked comfortable. Capable of a good game here and there, but overall just not Arsenal quality.\r\nRB: Bacary Sagna – Also in his second season, Sagna played 49 games in all competitions this year and looked to be a shrewd acquisition from the regular Wenger hunting ground of the French divisions.\r\nCB: William Gallas – Always known as the defender who wore the #10 much to the disdain of OCD football fans worldwide. The Arsenal captain was already very much in the bad-books with Arsenal fans following an incident earlier in the year in which he seemed to give up and take a seat on the pitch during an opposition attack – not showing the leadership qualities of a captain at all.\r\nCB: Kolo Toure – Not his best years in an Arsenal shirt, but solid nonetheless. A couple of years before his move to Manchester City where his career began to decline rapidly.\r\nLB: Gael Clichy – One of five players on this team to go on to be signed by Manchester City during their buying spell over the next couple of years. Clichy was another classic shrewd Wenger signing from the French leagues and proved a capable replacement for Cole, if not quite as talented.\r\nCM: Abou Diaby – Diaby was a player of clear quality and 08/09 was his first run of significant gametime at Arsenal. Unfortunately, Diaby was one of many players who had careers ruined as a trend formed where other teams would seek to tackle Arsenal players as hard as possible under the pretence that Arsenal were a weak-minded team to be got at. Unfortunately, this ended many careers too early.\r\nCM: Cesc Fabregas – Arsenal’s golden boy. In the Arsenal first team since he was 16 and club captain by this point. All signs pointed to Arsenal building their whole team around Fabregas. That was until Barcelona, his hometown club, engaged in very underhanded tactics to lure him back home which eventually worked and Fabregas forced his way out of the club that had given him so much.\r\nRW: Samir Nasri – Nasri’s first season at the club, and while not his best, many could see the talent there to be moulded. Nasri went on to have his best season ever a couple of years later, and then forced a move to Manchester City. Like all the others, he never lived up to his Arsenal days.\r\nLW: Andrey Arshavin – Signed on deadline day, past the actual deadline while the snow was falling. The Russian arrived to a comfortably cold England and had an instant impact grabbing 6 league goals in his first 12 games. Unfortunately, his effort dwindled and his career became a shadow of what it once was in the first couple of years at Arsenal.\r\nCF: Emmanuel Adebayor – Adedayor’s last season at Arsenal before a big-money move to Manchester City. His head was already turned slightly during this season where he didn’t match his previous breakout season. Adebayor like almost every other player, played his best football at Arsenal and eventually became an Arsenal villain after celebrating in inflammatory circumstances during a game against Arsenal.\r\nCF: Robin Van Persie – At this point RVP was still struggling with injuries but did grab 20 goals in all competitions. A couple of seasons later, he would explode into form before leaving Arsenal to help another Manchester club win the league.', '2021-05-27', 'uploads/Arsenal Team 200809 Profile.jpg'),
(2, 'Arsenal Team 2012/13 Profile', 'Conor Kelly', 'New firepower up front, but the same old faltering Arsenal…', 'GK: Wojciech Szczesny – A somewhat enigmatic goalkeeper as his talent was abundantly clear, but sometimes error-prone and with some attitude problems. Szczesny left for Italy in 2015/2016 and went on to become a star goalkeeper for Juventus and a multiple scudetto winner.\r\nRB: Bacary Sagna – Sagna was a strong, resilient full back of the late Wenger years. 12/13 saw him still regaining fitness and form after his leg break at the end of the previous season. He regained form the next year before his transfer to Manchester City.\r\nCB: Thomas Vermaelen – The goalscoring Belgian centre-back scored 0 goals that season for Arsenal despite playing 29 league games. It was at this point that Vermaelen’s game began to decline has his achilles injuries began to hamper his fitness. His last full season before he fell upwards to Barcelona.\r\nLB: Kieran Gibbs – Gibbs is probably most remembered as the player who was sent off incorrectly by referee Andre Marriner in an unusual case of mistaken identity. Gibbs, an Arsenal academy graduate, was playing his most Arsenal football around this time, but time has shown that he was probably never of the calibre required as he is now a bit-part player for West Brom.\r\nCM: Mikel Arteta – In his prime years at the club, and vice-captain at this point. Arteta would go on to captain the club, and become present-day club manager. He was an astute possession recycler, with a cynical edge to his game that was often missing from Arsenal sides. He’s been okay as Arsenal manager, but the jury is still out.\r\nCM: Santi Cazorla – Cazorla’s debut season at Arsenal and what a season! Signed as a player who could play wither wing or midfield, Santi’s long-range shooting and deft finishing became a powerful cannon in the Gunners’ armoury that season. Cazorla netted 12 league goals with some real stunning finishes among them.\r\nAM: Thomas Rosicky – Rosicky’s time at Arsenal was constantly hampered by injury. But the rock-and-roll Czech attacking midfielder was always close to the hearts of Arsenal fans. Despite injuries, Rosicky never seemed out-of-form. He scored at least one goal in 8/9 seasons for Arsenal and was a player who would routinely pop up with an important goal after a spell out injured.\r\nRW: Theo Walcott – Undoubtedly, this was Walcott’s best season in an Arsenal shirt in which he scored 21 goals in all competitions from the right wing position. Walcott was known as one of the fastest high-level players in the game and his rapid pace meant that teams needed to set up specifically to avoid getting exploited by Theo. He took a step up this season that unfortunately, like many other Arsenal players, was soon cut short by significant injuries.\r\nLW: Lukas Podolski – The man with the rocket of a left foot. ‘Poldi’s’ first season in an Arsenal shirt and he arrived with a bang, grabbing 11 league goals from left wing. Somewhat of a one-trick-pony, Lukas’ strength was his extremely powerful shots with his favoured left foot. If he hit it correctly, all the goalkeeper could do it stand and watch.\r\nCF: Olivier Giroud – Giroud’s first season at Arsenal, in retrospect, really set the tone for the rest of his Arsenal career. He regularly missed big chances and felt like a square peg in a round hole. He’d arrived off the back of a strong goalscoring season in which he’d helped Montpellier win a surprise French league title but he could never replicate that form at Arsenal.', '2021-05-28', 'uploads/Arsenal Team 201213 Profile.jpg'),
(3, 'Arsenal Team 2016/17 Profile', 'Darragh O Reilly', 'One of the most interesting Arsenal teams of recent years…', 'GK: Petr Cech – The Czech goalkeeper arrive at Arsenal and seemed to add a decent level of experience to the role. As the years progressed, his age seemed to become more of a factor and he hit a rapid enough decline. His inability to get down for low shots became a big problem and was then dropped.\r\nRB: Hector Bellerin – At this point in his Arsenal career, Bellerin still had his frightening pace and was establishing himself as a real attacking threat. Many could see that the defensive side of his game needed work, but for a young wing back with this amount of potential, not many were worried because most felt it would come with age and experience.\r\nCB: Shkodran Mustafi – If you want the full run-down, read our post on Arsenal’s worst ever transfers. He initially played quite well in this season and appeared in 26 league games, even grabbing a couple of goals. However, this initial form was not to last.\r\nCB: Laurent Koscielny – By this point Koscienly had put his early Arsenal woes to bed and had established himself as a rock at the heart of the Arsenal defence. He still had the odd error, or own goal in him, but was one of the best last-ditch tacklers out there – a position Arsenal’s defensive frailties put him in quite often.\r\nLB: Nacho Monreal – Another fan-favourite, humble left-back. Not quite the same mould as current LB Kieran Tierney, but Monreal played with a lot of heart and desire. He played in 36 league games that season, and would go on to have a good goalscoring spell the next season leading the fans affectionately nicknaming him ‘La Cabra’, meaning ‘The Goat’ in Spanish, playing of the term G.O.A.T meaning ‘Greatest of all Time’.\r\nCM: Aaron Ramsey – One of Ramsey’s quieter years, although he did grab the winning goal in an FA Cup final for the second time in his Arsenal career – one of only 4 goals the Welshman scored in all competitions that season.\r\nCM: Santi Cazorla – Unfortunately, Cazorla’s season was sparse this year as he’d suffered some serious injuries. The last of which threatened his ability to ever walk again as he faced extreme infection following surgery. Cazorla was a fan favourite and many were delighted to see him return  to form after leaving Arsenal and score a whopping 22 goals in 86 games from midfield for Villarreal.\r\nCM: Granit Xhaka – This was Xhaka’s first season in an Arsenal shirt and many Arsenal fans had been promised the ‘German Xabi Alonso’, unfortunately time has shown that this was absolutely not the case. Regardless, the Swiss international racked up 220 games in total for Arsenal with many highs and lows.\r\nRW: Mesut Ozil – One of his best seasons for Arsenal, combining well with Sanchez and netting 12 goals in all competitions.\r\nLW: Alexis Sanchez – The Chilean bulldog had his best season in an Arsenal shirt, grabbing an astounding 24 league goals from the wing. For some reason, Sanchez is somewhat forgotten about at Arsenal but he burned so brightly while he was at the club.\r\nST: Olivier Giroud – With the handsome Frenchman poised to potentially become France’s top goal scorer, dethroning the legendary Henry, it’s amusing to look back at his goal tallies for Arsenal. Netting only 12 league goals this season with his best return being 16 – Arsenal and Giroud where just never a good fit.\r\n', '2021-05-29', 'uploads/Arsenal Team 201617 Profile.jpg'),
(4, 'The Worst Arsenal Matches of the 21st Century', 'Conor Kelly', 'The games we wish we could forget…', '2011/12 Premier League: Manchester United 8 - 2 Arsenal – I think if you ask any Arsenal fan what the worst game they can remember is 99% will answer with the 8-2. The other 1% have probably successfully wiped it from their memory. A humiliating defeat against an arch-rival. A game that seemed to last days, and showed no signs of stopping. The most humiliating aspect is that it wasn’t even that strong of a Manchester United team – but it became a defeat that solidified the notion to a lot of people in the game that Arsenal are a weak team, and can be exploited.\r\n2013/14 Premier League: Chelsea 6-0 Arsenal – A terrible result in and of itself, no doubt. But the real slap-in-the-face of this result was that it marked the historic Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger’s 1,000th game at the club. With a bizarre sending off in the 16th minute, Arsenal had already gone 3-0 and a player down with most of the game left to play. The result could have been even worse, but it was a defeat that left a lot of fans feeling like the players had let down a great man on what was supposed to be a great day.\r\n2013/14 Premier League: Man City 6-3 Arsenal – Again, a bad result but made even worse in retrospect by the fact that it was only a short time before the above 6-0 defeat. It was at this point Arsenal looked their most weak, and vulnerable. Despite scoring 3 goals against a strong Man City side, these two results together really highlighted Arsenal’s defensive frailties at the time.\r\n2015/16 Premier League: Southampton 4-0 Arsenal – 2015/16 was a fairy-tale season, for Leicester City… Because of the Leicester story, few other fans will have realised how close Arsenal were to winning the league that season. Their failure to do so, at the time when every other ‘big’ team was faltering around them, will have to be the biggest regret of recent Arsenal memory. This failure, for me, is summed up in the Southampton game. There’s a saying in the Premier League that whoever leads the championship at Christmas, often goes on to win the league. With the Boxing Day fixture looming, an Arsenal win against a struggling Southampton side would put them top of the Premier League. A crushing, humbling defeat followed as many Arsenal fans in pubs across the nation watched their team on T.V. get pummelled again when it mattered most. Full-back Cuco Martina, who had only ever scored a couple of goals in his whole career, started proceedings with an unbelievable goal and it only got worse from there for the Gunners. It’s hard not to feel like the title challenge fell apart at this moment.\r\n', '2021-05-30', 'uploads/The Worst Arsenal Matches of the 21st Century.jpg'),
(8, 'The Greatest Arsenal Matches of the 21st Century', 'Chloe Smith', 'The games we’ll never forget…', '2002 FA Cup Final: Arsenal 2 – 0 Chelsea – This is the first game I remember as an Arsenal fan, probably the one that made me become one. My brother was watching the match and I sat alongside, only a small child. The two goals scored were of such tremendous quality and I remember being enamoured with the striking red mohawk of the flamboyant Freddie Ljungberg as he cast John Terry aside on a bursting run through to make it 2-0. I remember the commentator shouting ‘IT’S ONLY RAY PARLOUR’ as he scored an uncharacteristic screamer to give Arsenal the lead.\r\n2006 Champions League Round of 16: Real Madrid 0 – 1 Arsenal – Despite the disappointment of the final, I’ll never forget the run-up to the final and Arsenal being well aware of the insurmountable task ahead of them: needing to beat the star-studded Real Madrid and the Santiago Bernabeu fortress to progress on the road to the club’s first ever Champions League Final. Thierry Henry showed his usual mixture of elegance and strength to shrug off many challenges on the way to scoring the only goal of the two-legged tie.\r\n2003/04 Premier League: Tottenham Hotspur 2 – 2 Arsenal – This one is less about the result, or dazzling football and more about the context. Arsenal were able to secure the Premier League with a draw result at the ground of their fiercest rivals, grabbing the ultimate bragging rights in English football. The ability to tout to rival finals that Arsenal have won more league titles at Tottenham stadiums that Tottenham have, is one that will always be revered among Arsenal fans.\r\n2005/06 Premiere League: Arsenal 4-2 Wigan Athletic – Arsenal’s final game at the historic Highbury stadium before their move to the Emirates Stadium at the beginning of the next season. Arsenal needed to win, and their rivals Tottenham had to lose in order to secure Champions League football for the next season. It was a fairy-tale end for a football ground which had already seen many fairy-tale stories.\r\n2011 Champions League Round of 16: Arsenal 2-1 Barcelona – Not a fixture of great significance as Arsenal ultimately lost the tie on aggregate, but this fixture marked the arrival of Arsenal’s newest golden boy: Jack Wilshere. Aged just 19 at the time, Wilshere completely dominated single-handedly against Barcelona’s dynastic midfield – a midfield trio that had been held aloft for a long time in football as the greatest to have played the game. Arsenal recovered to win the game 2-1 with a powerful, emotional goal from Andrey Arshavin.\r\n2014 FA Cup Final: Arsenal 3 – 2 Hull City – Beating Hull City might not be worthy of much celebration itself, but this final marked the end of a long trophy drought for Arsenal. They also went 2-0 very early in the game, and it looks like more disappointment for Arsenal fans. A great free-kick from Cazorla, a characteristically clutch goal from Koscielny and an extra-time winner from Aaron Ramsey lifted the weight of the world from the shoulders of the club and manager.\r\n', '2021-06-02', 'uploads/The Greatest Arsenal Matches of the 21st Century.jpg'),
(9, 'The Worst Arsenal Transfers of the 21st Century', 'Conor Kelly', 'Some of the biggest Arsenal transfer market missteps…', 'Shkodran Mustafi – Signing for in excess of £35m, Mustafi reached over 100 league appearances for Arsenal. In my eyes, he’s the worst signing Arsenal have made. Arsenal have signed worst players, no doubt – but none as damaging as Mustafi. Despite some patches of strong form, Mustafi displayed a severe lack of footballing intelligence on a weekly basis. His inability to stay on his feet and shepherd the attacking player, no doubt his worst attribute. Skhodran’s approach was instead often to dive head-first into challenges often leaving himself on the ground, while the attacker has already passed him. Mustafi finally left the club with Kolasinac to Schalke and was voted ‘loser of the season’ by German fans after Schalke were relegated from the Bundesliga.\r\nGervinho – Gervinho showed some glimpses of a quality player at times, but ultimately, like many on this list, it was his footballing intelligence which ultimately held him back. His inability to make a good decision while on the ball was a noteworthy problem. Gervinho, often referred to as five-head due to the size of his forehead, was a frustrating player to watch as an Arsenal fan. He wasn’t always bad, but that’s what made him so frustrating – because you know 1/10 times he’d get it right.\r\nAndrey Arshavin – Perhaps undeserved on this list, as Andrey was a very likable figure – and despite his poor work ethic, an argument could be made that he was too often played out of position. Unlike most others on this list, I don’t blame Andrey for his role in being a bad Arsenal transfer, but it’s impossible to look past the potential of this one – remember the staggering 4-goal game against Liverpool?\r\nAndré Santos – Another player who lack intelligence on the pitch, although with André he often lacked it off the pitch also. He did score a crucial goal to guarantee Arsenal Champions League football one year, but overall Santos was a liability and a bit of a joke. Not quite winger, not quite defender, Santos’ playstyle is definitely a product of his country. Brazilian club teams often play with a wing-back/winger hybrid on each side whereas in England you’re more likely to see two different players in two different roles here. Despite all this, he was still terrible.\r\nSebastian Squillaci – I don’t think any other player filled me with less confidence than Squillaci. I remember Squillaci, a bit-part defender, being substituted on as an extra defensive body late in the game to hold on to a narrow lead. If I was a gambler, at that point I would have bet for the other team to score, and I would have been right. Squillaci wasn’t expensive, and he wasn’t depended on to play much, but everything he touched turned to goal, and not in a good way…\r\nPark Chu-Young – It’s hard to say whether Park belongs on this list but it’s such a bizarre transfer that it’s hard not to include. He was signed at a time when signing Asian players was fashionable, as their mere presence brought in significant commercial revenue, and this is the only explanation that might explain just what happened. Basically, Park was signed and then just almost disappeared. He played a grand total of 7 games in an Arsenal shirt and I have a distinct memory of him scoring a very nice goal against Bolton in the cup – a goal that showed he had genuine talent. Yet he was barely seen again.\r\n', '2021-06-05', 'uploads/The Worst Arsenal Transfers of the 21st Century.jpg'),
(11, 'The Arsenal Invincibles Team Profile', 'Darragh O Reilly', 'A look at the greatest team in Premier League history…', 'GK: Jens Lehmann – The mad German goalie. An undoubtedly talented goalkeeper but never a dull moment with Jens. Jens never quite seemed the calibre of goalkeeper you’d need to produce an invincible season yet here we are!\r\nRB: Lauren – The forgotten man. Lauren, the Cameroonian international, also on reflection doesn’t seem like the quality of player you would need to pull off this sort of feat. Yet his consistency, resilience and temperament were an integral part of the mental strength needed to go a whole season undefeated.\r\nCB: Sol Campbell – The lion at the heart of the defence. Sol was a towering presence, with great athleticism. Never afraid to get stuck into a tackle, and definitely possessed that ‘steel’ that many have been saying has been missing from the Arsenal defence for year.\r\nCB: Kolo Toure – It’s hard to believe that Toure was such an important part of this team. He was an unbelievable defender at the time, and the path that his career took after this, from invincible defender to meme-status is staggering. Few rival fans believe me when I try to tell them just how good this madman used to be.\r\nLB: Ashley Cole – It’s difficult to look back and appreciate how amazing Ashley Cole was as a left-back. He was probably the best left-back the Premier League has ever seen. However, I think he’ll always be viewed in Arsenal fan’s eyes as the epitome of the change in the English game. Cole leaving Arsenal in the circumstances he did really pinpoints the time which the game changed from being about the football, to being about money.\r\nDM: Gilberto Silva – Another player who just doesn’t seem good enough for this type of achievement, however his partnership with Vieira was one of real grit. Those two were simply not letting you get through no matter what you wanted to do. Gilberto’s ability to quietly hold position and break up play dependably mean that the other 5 players could confidently form a streaming counter-attack forward. You can only attack with that level of vigour if you truly trust the guys behind you.\r\nCM: Patrick Vieira – Possibly the most complete midfielder in Premier League history. He had grace, power, grit and everything in between. His mixture of athleticism, intelligence and genuine technique meant that on his day, he was simply unplayable.\r\nRW: Freddie Ljungberg – Ljungberg’s goal in the FA cup final a couple of years previously was the reason I became a fan. He had flair, technique and gave his all every time. A real fan favourite, and it’s a shame that his short stint as manager didn’t work out.\r\nLW: Robert Pires – Greatly disliked by the English media, Pires played his like a peacock – not afraid to show his feathers. When you rewatch the goals of this season, you’d be struck by how many Pires tap-ins there are. His movement proved to be an integral part of the goalscoring, often following in a rebound. His goal against Southampton remains one of the most skilful I’ve ever seen in the league.\r\nST: Dennis Bergkamp – Technique incarnate. Crucial for the build-up of many great goals and a legend at the club. Not much needs to be said.\r\nST: Thierry Henry - The jewel in the crown. In my opinion, Henry is the best player to grace the English game. Henry played the most of anyone during this season, and notched 30 league goals to boot.', '2021-06-08', 'uploads/The Arsenal Invincibles Team Profile.jpg'),
(12, 'Arsenal 2020/2021 Team Profile – Fringe Players Part 1', 'Darragh O Reilly', 'Part 1 of the overview of those on the edges of the first team…', 'Bukayo Saka – Saka burst on to the scene last year and built on that success with a strong year with lots of playtime. He hasn’t progressed at the same rate as last year, but player development isn’t linear and his playtime/experience this year will grow him into a better player. Also part of the England set-up for Euro 2021.\r\n\r\nDavid Luiz – Luiz’s last season as an Arsenal player. The same old Luiz we’ve always known. Arsenal will miss his long-range passing, but with Ruben Neves touted as a potential target, it’ll make sense to move that passing range further up the pitch.\r\n\r\nEmile Smith-Rowe – A breakout season for the ‘Croydon De Bruyne’ as Smith-Rowe showed he has talent and grit in equal measures. Regularly grabbing games by the scruff of the neck and making things happen, Smith-Rowe has a bright future in the game and seems to have put his earlier injury problems behind him.\r\n\r\nWillian – Potentially one of the worst Arsenal signings ever, to the surprise of few. Brought in on a free transfer and high wages, the aging Brazilian hampered Arsenal’s attack in just about every way imaginable. Despite a stellar debut, Willian went on to put in a plethora of pathetic appearances and seems to be on the way out already.\r\n\r\nGabriel Martinelli – Recovering from a massive knee injury, Martinelli was very slowly reintroduced to the team. Pegged by many to be one of the brightest young talents in the world pre-injury, Martinelli struggled to regain his place in the team even after regaining fitness.\r\n\r\nPablo Marí – Marí managed 16 appearances in his first full season as an Arsenal player. He’s shown he can be a composed presence on the ball, and an aerial force, but definitely needs to work on rounding out the defensive side of his game to threaten for a place in the team. Has shades of Per Mertesacker in the way he uses his reading of the game to offset his lack of pace.\r\n\r\nRúnar Alex Rúnarsson – The less said here the better! Picked up for a very small transfer fee in this day and age, on the recommendation of the goalkeeping coach who thought he had unrealised potential. Fans were sceptical when reports showed he was statistically the worst keeper in his division. These scepticisms were realised when Rúnarsson let in a free-kick that way hit directly at him in the Europa League. He wasn’t seen much after that…\r\n', '2021-06-11', 'uploads/Arsenal 20202021 Team Profile – Fringe Players Part 1.jpg'),
(13, 'Arsenal 2020/2021 Team Profile – Fringe Players Part 2', 'Chloe Smith', 'Part 2 of the bit-part players of last season…', 'Cédric Soares – Dipping in and out of the team, Soares seemed to be the answer to Arsenal’s problems at one point. However, like many other times, a hyped-up answer seemed to be premature as Cédric struggled for consistency and form and was barely seen at the season’s close with Calum Chambers most often occupying the RB role.\r\nJoe Willock – Perhaps the season’s biggest enigma. Willock has always been a goalscoring midfielder. However, he has always looked off the Premier League’s level. Most predicted for Joe to go on and have a strong but unremarkable career in the Championship or even League One if he didn’t realise his potential. However, a loan move to Premier League side Newcastle proved revolutionary as Willock scored in 7 games in a row, equalling the record of some Premier League greats. His future now becomes one of the most interesting things to keep an eye on.\r\nMatteo Guendouzi – Despite clearly having bags and bags of talent, Matteo Guendouzi looks to be next in the line of players whose attitudes will totally derail a potentially great career. Matteo spent the season out on loan at Hertha Berlin where he notched up 24 league games. The 22-year old has got a lot of high-level footballing experience under his belt but his attitude remains a big problem. Reports are circulating that put him quite close to a move to Marseille in his homeland, a team which never seems too far away from these kinds of players – Hatem Ben Arfa and Joey Barton as two shining examples.\r\nKonstantinos Mavropanos – The Greek centre-back has quietly impressed while on loan in Germany over the past couple of seasons. Racking up 11 games for Nurnberg last year in the second division, then 21 for Stuttgart in the Bundesliga – reports coming out of Germany indicated that ‘Dinos’ had a very good season, culminating in Greek international callups for the Euros.\r\nCalum Chambers – Another Arsenal player whose career development was hampered by serious injury, most fans would have assumed his time at the Gunners was nearing an end. However, Calum had a late resurgence to the team. What started as aerial reinforcement to counter-act a wide target man from the opposition became a mainstay in run-in at the end of the season. We’ll be curious to see is Calum retains his place.\r\nWilliam Saliba – Another Arsenal enigma. Touted as one of the great young centre-backs of the world, Saliba was ignored by Arteta and suffered great personal loss as both of his parents passed away in a short space of time while he was about to leave home as an 18-year old. He was allowed to return to France on loan where he immediately impressed again. Surely a long-term project for Arsenal as Saliba seems to be a potential star – however, he needs to actually play for Arsenal first…\r\n', '2021-06-12', 'uploads/Arsenal 20202021 Team Profile – Fringe Players Part 2.jpg'),

Leno sometimes has trouble claiming crosses and with decision-making. A prime example of poor decision making is when 10-man Arsenal were reduced to 9 after Leno handled the ball outside the box against Wolves in the Premier League in February 2021. RB: Hector Bellerin – A forgettable season for Bellerin as he recovered still from an ACL injury in 2019. Bellerin’s characteristic explosive pace seems to have disappeared, and despite the odd shining run through the middle, the Spaniard’s attacking output seems to have left him entirely.  CB: Gabriel – A fantastic debut season from the towering Brazilian. Despite the odd hiccup as he settled, and the disruption that contracting Covid-19 had on his fitness, Gabriel has shown a toughness that has been missing from the Arsenal backline for some time.  CB: Rob Holding – Holding never seems to dazzle, but has held his place in the Arsenal XI nonetheless. He’s reminiscent of an old-school Wenger/Ferguson player, one which you get the impression may be playing above his own level – but never seems to play bad enough to warrant dropping. LB: Kieran Tierney – The fan-favourite. In a footballing world of glitz and glam, Tierney is the humble Scot who wears his heart on his sleeve every game. As a boyhood Bhoy, some wondered whether this passion would translate to the metropolitan London club – however, I doubt there are still any doubters. DM: Granit Xhaka – More of the same from the most polarising player in recent Arsenal memory. The Swiss marmite playmaker seems to have most likely played his final minutes for the reds as a move to Serie A seems to be on the cards. I doubt many will truly miss Granit, but perhaps it’ll be a case of ‘be careful what you wish for’! CM: Thomas Partey  - Debut season for the Ghanaian, and showed glimpses of a player that can elevate Arsenal to the next level. The first midfielder Arsenal have had that can play the press since Santi Cazorla. A crucial player if Arsenal are ever going to take that next step, but needs quality around him as he can’t do it all himself. AM: Martin Ødegaard – On loan from Real Madrid. Martin showed that he has real talent, and could definitely play a part in Arsenal’s long term future but it seems unlikely that Madrid will offload him – especially now since Zidane has left.  RW: Nicolas Pépé – Built on a strong first season and really hit some good form at the end of the season. Clearly has the talent, but needs Arsenal to play in a certain way to get the most from him.  LW: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – Signing on a lucrative new deal, Auba showed some signs of heading the way of Mesut Ozil, the last thing Arsenal fans wanted to see. Auba struggled massively for form, and contracted malaria mid-season. A season to forget. CF: Alexandre Lacazette – A forgettable season again for the French forward. He seems to be past his peak. Still a hard worker, and brings some elements to Arsenal’s game, but often lacks the real quality to make a difference. ', '2021-06-14', 'uploads/Arsenal 20202021 Team Profile – Starting XI.jpg');
